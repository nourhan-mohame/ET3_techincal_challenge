**Problem:** You have a folder containing images, and you want to achieve the following tasks:

1. Rename each image to have a consistent format like "image_1", "image_2", and so on.
2. Create a CSV report that includes the new names of each image.
3. Include the image size in a human-readable format with appropriate units (e.g., KB, MB) in the CSV report.
4. Include the last modification date of each image in a short date format (YYYY-MM-DD) in the CSV report.

**Solution:** To solve this problem, you can use a Python script with the following steps:

1. Import necessary libraries for file operations, date handling, and CSV manipulation.
2. Define two functions:
   - `get_short_date(timestamp)`: Converts a Unix timestamp to a short date format (YYYY-MM-DD).
   - `get_size_with_unit(size)`: Converts a file size in bytes to a human-readable format with appropriate units (e.g., KB, MB).
3. Specify the paths for the input folder, output folder, and CSV file name. Create the output folder if it doesn't exist.
4. Initialize variables to count images and store image data for the CSV report.
5. Loop through files in the input folder, filtering for common image file extensions.
6. Copy each image to the output folder with a new name (e.g., "image_1.jpg").
7. Retrieve the size of the image in bytes and the modification date as a timestamp.
8. Convert the timestamp to a short date format and the image size to a human-readable format with appropriate units.
9. Append the image data (new filename, size with units, and short date) to a list for the CSV report.
10. Write the image data to a CSV report file with appropriate headers.
11. Print a summary of the process, indicating the number of images processed and the location of the CSV report.

This Python script efficiently organizes your images, renames them, and creates a CSV report with the new names, image sizes with units, and modification dates in a more human-readable format.
