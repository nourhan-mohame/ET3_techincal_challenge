The code is an Object Detector that utilizes a YOLOv5 model for object detection in images. It initializes the detector with the YOLOv5 model and a confidence threshold. It also loads a list of excluded objects from a text file. The detect_objects method processes an image, identifies objects, and returns their labels, confidence scores, and bounding box coordinates. The detector handles labels enclosed in curly braces, extracting the content inside them. Bounding boxes are drawn on the image for detected objects, and results are saved in an output folder. The process_images_in_folder function processes multiple images in a folder, stores detected objects, and saves the modified images. Detected objects are then saved in a JSON file, where each object is represented by its label, confidence score, and bounding box. This code is useful for automating object detection tasks, such as identifying and annotating objects in images.
